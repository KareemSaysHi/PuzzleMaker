# PuzzleMaker
It makes puzzles :)

I'm attempting to write a program that can find the most difficult puzzle possible for my little picnic basket puzzles that I post over at https://github.com/KareemSaysHi/PuzzleMaker.  Right now, I'm focusing on assembling and disassembling 2D puzzles, and after that's done I'll work on doing it with 3D, and then implementing rotation :D
